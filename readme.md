# Frusciante Facts

Frusciante facts is a page made to create a historical database for American musician John Frusciante, covering facts about his career, discography and musical equipment.
Users of this site will able to discover facts about his life, explore his discography and find out what musical gear (guitars, synthesizers etc) has been used on famous tracks and performances. This last section will allow the user to recreate the sounds of songs/performances that they like. I thought it also has potential for affiliate links as pages of gear or music can have direct links on them to find that specific piece of gear or song/album.

## Navigation:

- The navigation bar starts from the left, first featuring the name of the site “Frusciante Facts”, which acts as a homepage button when clicked
- The three links on the right of the page take you to different pages. The “About” leads to a page featuring a brief biography of the artist. The “Discography leads to a gallery of John’s album art, which when clicked, leads you to an individual page for that album, as well as the albums tracklisting, release date and a link to listen to the album (all of these links lead to user made playlists of each album which all feature uploads from the official Chili Peppers YouTube page rather than a 3rd party upload which could be taken down. The last section, “Gear”, features equipment used on tour by John, which appeals to those who want to recreate his sound
- The bar has been laid out the way it has to accommodate for the users visit. For example, the about section is for those wanting to know about the artist, the discography page is set out for the use to discover or rediscover the artists back catalogue and the gear page caters for the more knowledgeable user who may already be aware of the artists story and or/music and want to know how themselves can recreate such sounds. It can also cater to a newer user who lets say has learned about the artist through the site as well as heard some of the music from the external links and are inspired by what they have heard and want to make similar music

## About 

- 	A page giving a brief history about the artist. Due to time constraints, this information has been sourced from WikiPedia as a placeholder which I have also credited on the page for full transparency 
- 	This page, when fully finished, will be a more informative page to give the user a better understanding of the artist and their story, whereas at the moment it is more something more along the lines of an appetizer

## Discography

-	A page that features a chronological flow of the artists album art that leads to a page featuring that albums release date, tracklist and an external link leading to an audio playlist that allows you to listen to that albums
-	Due to time constraints , I have only added John’s work with the Chili Peppers thus far but have adhered to a column layout with shared code for the individual album pages so these can be added at a later date. 
-	As mentioned, I haven’t covered every album yet so I have kept the image sizes on this page quite large to avoid the page looking bare and to catch the users eye

## Gear

-	The “Gear” section of the website will feature equipment John has used on certain albums/performances, as well as the sources of the information for full transparency

## Bugs

- At the moment, I'm having a bit of an issue using media queries to make the site look better in mobile so I'm currently looking into a fix for this

## Testing

- Each time a new HTML page has been made, I have used the HTTP Server on GitPod to make sure the page leads you to the right place. For example, I had originally had an issue opening the Gear page from the Discography page. When I searched the HTML for causes, it seems that there was a typo in the href for the gear page in the Discography html. When this was corrected, it took me to the correct page.

- The site was also tested for smaller screens. However, I was having an issue when trying to center my headings and text for a mobile page. While I had been testing on a browser window a lot so I knew how each internal and external link would work, mobile testing was left a little bit late. I will revise into media queries for the next submission and potential resubmission of this project.

## Validator Testing

- Each  individual page has been put through W3 Validator and all edits have been made to the HTML so there are no real issues other than the discography page where it has asked for a title for one of the sections
- Currently no CSS errors. Only one was flagged in the text area whhen using the W3C CSS Validator and this was quickly amended

## Deployment

- This site was deployed by going to the repository, clicking it's settings, finding the pages tab and then hit Deploy from branch and selected my root folder

- The live site can be found at https://arunhtv.github.io/portfolio-one/index.html
